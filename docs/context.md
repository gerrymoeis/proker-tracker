# Project Context: Proker Tracker

## Project Overview

"Proker Tracker" is a specialized mobile application designed specifically for student organizations in universities and colleges. Unlike general productivity apps, Proker Tracker targets the unique operational structure and dynamics of student organizations such as student councils (BEM), student associations (Himpunan), student activity units (UKM), and other campus organizations. The application aims to solve critical time management and work program coordination issues that are common in these organizations.

## Problem Statement

Student organizations face several distinctive challenges that general project management tools don't adequately address:

1. **Role-Based Workflow Management**: Student organizations have specific hierarchical structures with clearly defined roles (such as executive board members, department heads, and general members) that require tailored access and responsibilities.

2. **Academic Calendar Integration**: Student organizations must align their activities with the academic calendar, including exam periods, holidays, and semester breaks.

3. **Turnover Management**: Unlike professional organizations, student organizations experience complete leadership turnover annually or bi-annually, creating challenges in knowledge transfer and program continuity.

4. **Balancing Academic and Organizational Responsibilities**: Students must prioritize their academic commitments while managing organizational duties, creating unique time management challenges.

5. **Budget Cycle Alignment**: Student organizations typically operate on annual budget cycles tied to academic years, requiring specialized financial planning.

6. **Multi-Department Coordination**: Many student organizations have multiple departments organizing parallel or interrelated events that need coordination.

7. **Documentation and Legacy Building**: Organizations struggle with maintaining records and passing institutional knowledge to successive generations of leadership.

## Target Users

1. **Executive Board Members (BPH - Badan Pengurus Harian)**:
   - Chair/President
   - Vice Chair/Vice President
   - Secretary
   - Treasurer
   - Other core leadership positions

2. **Department Heads (Ketua Departemen)**:
   - Leaders of specific organizational departments (e.g., academic affairs, public relations, human resources)
   - Committee heads for specific programs or events

3. **Functional Officers (Fungsionaris)**:
   - Regular members with specific assigned tasks
   - Department members
   - Committee members
   - General active members

4. **Organizational Advisors**:
   - Faculty members supervising organizations
   - University staff liaisons

## Core Features Needed

   - Customized views and permissions based on organizational role
   - Hierarchical task assignment and approval workflows

2. **Visual Timeline Management**:
   - Interactive Gantt chart for program planning
   - Visual representation of overlapping programs and potential conflicts
   - Milestone tracking with clear indicators

3. **Academic Calendar Integration**:
   - Overlay of academic calendar events with organizational timeline
   - Automatic conflict detection with exam periods, holidays, etc.
   - Scheduling recommendations based on optimal timing

4. **Task Management System**:
   - Task assignment, tracking, and notification
   - Progress reporting and visualization
   - Due date management with smart reminders

5. **Continuity Tools**:
   - Program templates and documentation
   - Historical data access and reporting
   - Transition management features for leadership changes

6. **Communication Hub**:
   - Integrated messaging by role, department, and program
   - Announcement system with priority levels
   - Meeting management with minutes and action items

7. **Program Evaluation**:
   - Built-in evaluation forms and metrics
   - Post-mortem documentation tools
   - Success measurement against program objectives

## Unique Value Proposition

Proker Tracker differentiates itself from generic project management tools by:

1. **Organization-Specific Structure**: Built around the typical hierarchical structure of student organizations rather than corporate models.

2. **Academic-Organizational Balance**: Designed to help students manage both academic and organizational responsibilities effectively.

3. **Continuity Management**: Features specifically designed to facilitate smooth transition between leadership generations.

4. **Quick Onboarding**: Intuitive design that requires minimal training, acknowledging the temporary nature of student roles.

5. **Milestone-Driven Approach**: Focuses on program milestones that align with student organization workflows rather than daily tasks.

## Expected Challenges

1. **Diverse Organizational Structures**: Different organizations have varying structures and workflows that may require flexible configuration options.

2. **User Adoption**: Students often resist adopting new tools unless they provide immediate, obvious value.

3. **Offline Functionality**: Students may need to access information in areas with poor connectivity.

4. **Integration with Existing Systems**: Many universities have their own calendar systems, room booking systems, etc., that would ideally integrate with the application.

5. **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality**: Providing comprehensive features while maintaining an intuitive, clean interface.

## Success Criteria

1. **Improved Timeline Management**: Organizations report fewer scheduling conflicts and missed deadlines.

2. **Increased Program Completion Rate**: Higher percentage of planned programs successfully executed.

3. **Enhanced Organizational Knowledge Transfer**: New leadership reports smoother transitions and better understanding of previous activities.

4. **Reduced Coordination Overhead**: Decreased time spent in coordination meetings and communication.

5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from student organization members regarding usability and effectiveness.

6. **Organization Retention**: Organizations continue using the platform across multiple leadership transitions.

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Mobile-First But Platform-Agnostic**: Primary focus on mobile experience with web capability for more complex planning tasks.

2. **Clean, Visual Interface**: Emphasis on timeline visualization and intuitive navigation.

3. **Modular Structure**: Core features available to all with optional modules based on organizational needs.

4. **Offline-First Architecture**: Essential features functional without constant internet connectivity.

5. **Privacy-Centric**: Respecting student privacy while enabling effective collaboration.

6. **Contextual Learning**: Built-in guidance that appears only when relevant, reducing cognitive load.

## Long-Term Vision

While the initial release will focus on core timeline and task management features, the long-term vision includes:

1. **Analytics and Insights**: Providing organizations with data-driven insights about their operations.

2. **Inter-Organizational Collaboration**: Features to facilitate collaboration between different student organizations.

3. **University Ecosystem Integration**: Integration with university systems for room booking, budget approval, etc.

4. **Alumni Engagement**: Features to keep alumni connected and involved in organizational activities.

5. **Organizational Health Metrics**: Tools to measure and improve organizational effectiveness and member satisfaction.
